# Introduction

After cleaning data types & issues, you may still not have the exact data that you need, so you can create new columns from existing data to aid your analysis.
- Numeric columns – calculating percenatges, applying conditional calculations etc.
- Datetime columns – extracting datetime components, applying datetime calculations etc.
- Text columns – extracting text, splitting into multuiple columns, finding patterns etc.

# Creating-Numeric-Columns-in-Python

Hello, 

I've attached the data on our JUne pen sales.

Can you create two new columns?

- A "Total Spend" column that includes both the pen cost and shipping cost for each sale
- A "Free Shipping" column that says yes if the sale included free shipping, and no otherwise

Thanks!

Peter

## Key Objectives

3. Create a numeric column using arithmetic
4. Create a numeric column using condition logic

# Creating-DateTime-Columns-in-Python

Hello agin, 

Using the data I sent over last week, can you calculate the number of days between the purchase and delivery date for each sale and save it as a new column called 'Delivery Time'?

What were the average days from purchase to delivery?

Thanks !
Peter

## Key Objectives

1. Calculate the difference between two datetime columns and save it as a new colum
2. Take the average of the new column.
